# todo_redux_to_not
Let's remove Redux from the Redux todo example ðŸ˜‚

My goal is to show how much simpler a vanilla non-flux app can be, than a flux app.  I'm using `Redux` as my flux because it's
everyone's favorite, in turn because it advocates discarding a bunch of flux too (eg multiple stores.)

We start by following through the `Redux` step by step example, with vanilla JS implementations in their stead.

In the process, I hope to show that the added overhead of learning Flux and `Redux` concepts is unnecessary, and that all of these 
behaviors have natural implementations in the Javascript that you already know.

In essence, this is a `You Might Not Need Redux` site.
