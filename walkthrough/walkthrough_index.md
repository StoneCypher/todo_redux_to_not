# Walkthrough

You can either look at the walkthrough as a [single long document](walkthrough_longver.md), or broken up into the same [chapter structure](./chapters/01 - intro.md) as the original tutorial.

## Usage notes

If you'd like to play with the vanilla version locally, run any webserver from the `docs/vanilla` directory.

If you don't have one, an easy choice is `http-server` from `npm`.

```
npm install -g http-server
cd docs/vanilla
http-server .
```

You should now be able to hit, or alter, the vanilla version from [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) .
